streamflow_model.py

Here are small set of helper functions for the Hancock streamflow bug-hunt. Everything here runs with
just numpy and pandas, so you do not need PyTorch to load the model or run it. You can, of course,
just use TF/torch though, up to you. There are no hidden clues in here if that's what you are searching for...

Recall that the model is a plain MLP:
    77 inputs  ->  56 units x 6 hidden layers (ReLU)  ->   1 output

The 77 inputs for a given hour are the previous 72 hours of rainfall followed by 5
catchment features (sm_2in, sm_20in, season, T_air_C, srad_Wm2). They are z-scored
with the provided scaler before going into the network.

Main functions:
    load_weights(path): load the .npz weights as {name: array}
    forward(weights, X): run the network (optionally returns acts)
    build_features(data_csv, scaler_json): turn a CSV into the model inputs + target
    nse / rmse / cos_sim: simple scoring helpers I've included
